Syntax I am attempting to use:

  A html file is named foobar.html
  The method defined in urls.py that will link to it is named main_foobar 
  A link to the page will be /p_foobar/
  For the methods that deal with form data from these pages:
    m_foobar creates an entity (team / result / matchup / etc)
    u_foobar updates an entity (reregistration, updating a match time)

  Current files:
    index.html
    register.html
    brackets.html
    results.html
    contact.html

Add   login: required    to a handler>url in app.yaml to restrict a page to only logged in users.
