Syntax I am attempting to use:

  A html file is named foobar.html
  The method defined in urls.py that will link to it is named main_foobar 
  Pages will be linked in one of two ways:
    /c_foo/ if the page will be modifying data
  For the methods that deal with form data from these pages:
    m_foobar creates an entity (team / result / matchup / etc)
    u_foobar updates an entity (reregistration, updating a match time)

  Views have been refactored:
    /view/{type}/{value}/ will now show a single entities details
    	type: team, tournament
    	value: name
    /viewall/{type}/{value} will show a collection of entities
    	type: team, tournament
    	value: current, all

Add   login: required    to a handler>url in app.yaml to restrict a page to only logged in users.
